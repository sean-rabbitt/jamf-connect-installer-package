# Generic Jamf Connect Prestage Enrollment installer package
# â€” SRABBITT May 22, 2020 12:52 PM
# Version 2 installer updated on September 29, 2020
# Updated 20NOV2020 - Added wait for .AppleSetupDone to see if we can make Big Sur happier.

# What does it do:
#	Download latest version of Jamf Connect from the public latest version URL
#	Convert the DMG to a CDR to get rid of the license prompt
# 	Installs Jamf Connect
# 	Optional - code you can comment on to install the launch agent for the menu bar agent
#	Note - Don't install the launch agent with Google.  There's no ROPG from Google
# 		as defined in the OpenID spec, so there's no ongoing password sync with the menu bar
#	Unmount CDR
#	Delete downloaded tmp files

# HOW TO USE:
# 	Make an installer .pkg file and include this as postinstaller script
#	In the installer package, you can include things like branding images, 
#	backgrounds, logos, help files for users, etc.  The script here downloads 
#	Jamf Connect and installs it.
#
#	AUTHCHANGER NOTES: I took out the authchanger command because you should be
#	pushing your com.jamf.connect.login and com.jamf.connect configuration profiles
#	BEFORE installing this package.  See https://docs.jamf.com/jamf-connect/administrator-guide/authchanger.html
#	for all the deets on that.  You could, of course, also manually toss in some 
#	authchanger commands at the bottom of this for the lols.
